## Abstract

## 1. Introduction: Problem Statement and Understanding

Rivers are responsible for carrying water and nutrients to various parts of the earth.
Many animals, including humans, rely on rivers and the life they bring to thrive in otherwise
uninhabitable areas.
In this project, we work to analyze how various factors (human, river network, and climate)
impact the overall river flow in the Rocky Mountain area.

Through an initial exploratory data analysis, we found that we have more variables
than observations.
This means, should we create a linear regression model with every variable, the design
matrix would be rank-deficient, which would lead to several problems, including
no unique solution for the coefficients, multicollinearity, overfitting, high variance
in coefficients, and interpretability issues.

The data set also contains monthly averages for precipitation, temperature, and cumulative precipitation,
as well as annual averages for those same variables.
This is potentially problematic because including both the yearly and monthly
averages would introduce multicollinearity into the model.
Furthermore, some of the variables are direct linear combinations of others.
For example, the variable bio7 gives the annual temperature range, given by
subtracting the max temperature from the minimum, both of which are stored as
bio5 and bio6.
Thus we want to avoid including these in our model simultaneously.

In this project, we hope to find a predictive model for river flow based on
the given variables while simultaneously avoiding incorporating the aforementioned
problems into our model.
